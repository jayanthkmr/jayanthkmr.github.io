This preprint presents a unifying framework in which the four fundamental interactions emerge as constraint-enforcement mechanisms on an underlying information manifold. Gravity is reinterpreted as a global constraint on admissible state space over time, electromagnetism as phase dynamics between conjugate informational states, the weak interaction as a generator of time-asymmetric entropy flow, and the strong interaction as a local information confinement mechanism. The framework proposes a single variational principle based on constrained free-energy minimization from which classical gravity and gauge dynamics arise, avoiding direct quantization of gravity and reframing gauge symmetries as representational redundancies.
