This preprint presents Phase-XOR (PXOR) neural networks that operate on a four-valued phase logic alphabet \{1, I, -1, -I\} and replace real-valued weighted sums with cyclic phase composition. The work formalizes the PXOR perceptron, provides a deterministic learning rule with convergence guarantees, and demonstrates applications to parity learning, finite automata simulation, and phase-coded memory—highlighting reversible, hardware-efficient neural computation.
