excerpt: 'Opinion summarization is the task of producing the summary of a text, such that the summary also preserves the sentiment of the text. Opinion Summarization is thus a trade-off between summarization and sentiment analysis. The demand of compression may drop sentiment bearing sentences, and the demand of sentiment detection may bring in redundant sentences. We harness the power of submodularity to strike a balance between two conflicting requirements. We investigate an incipient class of submodular functions for the problem, and a partial enumeration based greedy algorithm that has performance guarantee of 63%. Our functions generate summaries such that there is good correlation between document sentiment and summary sentiment along with good ROUGE score, which outperforms thestate-of-the-art algorithms.'

This paper describes work on the morphological and syntactic annotation of Sumerian cuneiform as a model for low resource languages in general. Cuneiform texts are invaluable sources for the study of history, languages, economy, and cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia and its surrounding regions. Assyriology, the discipline dedicated to their study, has vast research potential, but lacks the modern means for computational processing and analysis. Our project, Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages, aims to fill this gap by bringing together corpus data, lexical data, linguistic annotations and object metadata. The projectâ€™s main goal is to build a pipeline for machine translation and annotation of Sumerian Ur III administrative texts. The rich and structured data is then to be made accessible in the form of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data (LLOD), which should open them to a larger research community. Our contribution is two-fold: in terms of language technology, our work represents the first attempt to develop an integrative infrastructure for the annotation of morphology and syntax on the basis of RDF technologies and LLOD resources. With respect to Assyriology, we work towards producing the first syntactically annotated corpus of Sumerian.
