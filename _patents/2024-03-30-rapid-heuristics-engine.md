Systems and methods are described for a rapid heuristics engine for defining and applying statistical heuristics for filtering network traffic. In some examples, several requests may be obtained from different sources to view media content provided through an online resource, where at least some of the requests are invalid requests. One or more heuristic rules may be obtained to identify invalid requests associated with one or more sources, whereas individual heuristic rules include one or more features and one or more expressions defining operations performed on or relating to one or more features to identify invalid requests. Values for one or more features may be compiled based on the plurality of requests. One or more invalid requests associated with one or more sources may be identified according to one or more heuristic rules using the compiled values for one or more features.
