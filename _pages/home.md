</h2>

Currently building best in class intelligence solutions for real estate and capital markets stakeholders at [Turl Street Group](https://turlstreetgroup.com/ "https://turlstreetgroup.com/"). I am a published poet, a technical architect, an entrepreneur, an angel investor, an engineering leader and even, an assistant professor too, basically a Polymath. 

I earned my bachelor's degree from [IIT Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay") and my master's degree from [University of California Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles")  in Computer Science departments. I formerly held the positions of software engineer at [SAP SE, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP") and [SAP Labs, Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page"). Later, as an entrepreneur, I held the positions of Head of Engineering at [Goodhealthapp](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4?source=about_page "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4"), Engineering Manager at [Delhivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery"), and later as Software Development Manager at [Amazon India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)"), as one of the youngest Engineering Leader in a FAANG. These challenging experiences made me grow not just into Technology but also, into People, Processes and Product leadership.

I always seek to challenge myself with new learning opportunities and focus on building robust mechanisms and systems, which will stand the test of the time.
