</h2>

Currently building best in class intelligence solutions for real estate and capital markets stakeholders at [Turl Street Group](https://turlstreetgroup.com/ "https://turlstreetgroup.com/"). I am a published poet, a technical architect, an entrepreneur, an angel investor, an engineering leader and even, an assistant professor too, basically a Polymath. 

I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree from [IIT Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay") and my master‚Äôs degree from [University of California Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles")  in Computer Science departments. I formerly held the positions of software engineer at [SAP SE, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP") and [SAP Labs, Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page"). Later, as an entrepreneur, I held the positions of Head of Engineering at [Goodhealthapp](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4?source=about_page "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4"), Engineering Manager at [Delhivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery"), and later as Software Development Manager at [Amazon India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)"), as one of the youngest Engineering Leader in a FAANG. These challenging experiences made me grow not just into Technology but also, into People, Processes and Product leadership.

I always seek to challenge myself with new learning opportunities and focus on building robust mechanisms and systems, which will stand the test of the time.

Subscribe to my website to read my book *Learning System Design on AWS* or *System Manifesto* or read my poetry anthology - "*Gonzo Poet and through his lens*" or follow my blog - "*Technopreneurial Treatises*" for more engineering and entrepreneurial philosophical content. 

You can book a 1:1 call or ask any queries you may have on my [email](mailto:jayanthjaiswal15@gmail.com). Whether you need help with my areas of expertise or just want to chat about anything, I'm available.

See you around üé©
