Here is a small walk-through of my journey so far.

I had [studied](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1719220438197419&id=444413752344767&source=about_page "https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1719220438197419&id=444413752344767") in Patna under the guidance of the famed [Super 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_30_(film)?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_30_(film)") mathematician, [Anand Kumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Kumar?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Kumar") till matriculation in 2008.

Later, I moved to [DPS R.K. Puram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Public_School,_R._K._Puram?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Public_School,_R._K._Puram") for my Science Intermediate and got admission in 2010 to the department of Computer Science at [IIT Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay") for my Bachelors degree.

During my bachelors at IIT Bombay, I interned with [e-Yantra Lab](https://new.e-yantra.org/?source=about_page "https://new.e-yantra.org/") in summer 2011, [Computer Science department](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/informatik?source=about_page "https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/informatik") at [TU Braunschweig, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Braunschweig?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Braunschweig") in summer 2012, [Edelweiss Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edelweiss_Group?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edelweiss_Group") algorithmic trading team in winter 2012, [Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank") rates and indices team in summer 2013. I graduated in 2014 with Bachelors in Computer Science with honors distinction, writing my theisis on [monotone submodularity in opinion summaries](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1017/?source=about_page "https://aclanthology.org/D15-1017/") under Prof. [Pushpak Bhattacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpak_Bhattacharyya?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpak_Bhattacharyya"), which won 3rd Best Verifiability, Reproducibility, and Working Description award in [CICLING 2015, Egpyt](http://www.cicling.org/2015/?source=about_page "http://www.cicling.org/2015/") as a poster presentation and later, got accepted into [EMNLP 2015, Lisbon, Portugal](https://www.emnlp2015.org/accepted-papers.html?source=about_page#short "https://www.emnlp2015.org/accepted-papers.html#short") as short journal paper for ACL anthology .

Post graduation, I started as a software developer in Predictive Maintenance and Services team in [SAP SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP"), [Walldorf, Germany](https://www.sap.com/india/about/company/office-locations/germany.html?source=about_page "https://www.sap.com/india/about/company/office-locations/germany.html") in 201, where I built proof of concepts for customers like [Trainitalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenitalia?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenitalia") and filed a [US patent application in Databases](https://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220170039232%22.PGNR.&OS=DN%2F20170039232&RS=DN%2F20170039232&source=about_page "https://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220170039232%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20170039232&RS=DN/20170039232").

After a year, I was transferred to [SAP Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP?source=about_page"), [Silicon Valley, Palo Alto, United States](https://www.sap.com/india/about/company/office-locations/usa.html?source=about_page "https://www.sap.com/india/about/company/office-locations/usa.html") to lead and build Predictive Maintenance SDK for the [Asset Intelligence team](https://www.sap.com/products/asset-intelligence-network.html?source=about_page "https://www.sap.com/products/asset-intelligence-network.html"). My job at SAP involved working with Big Data, IoT and Machine Learning technologies, so I enrolled and completed Data Mining Graduate Certificate from [Stanford Center for Professional Development](https://scpd.stanford.edu/?source=about_page "https://scpd.stanford.edu/"), a unit of [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University").

To continue my interests and education, I moved to [University of California Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles") to do my post-graduate Masters in Computer Science, writing my thesis on Multi-objective Deep Learning under [Prof. Kai Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/?source=about_page "http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/"). I also, served as graduate research lab leader at UCLA for [Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_Digital_Library_Initiative?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_Digital_Library_Initiative") and even, published some open-source research projects like [Pyoracc](https://pypi.org/project/pyoracc/?source=about_page "https://pypi.org/project/pyoracc/") on Pypi.

Meanwhile, I travelled 5 continents, 20 countries and covered 6 wonders of the world, still have to visit Great Wall of China. Along with this journey, I worked with 5 different research groups too - [e-Yantra lab IIT Bombay](https://new.e-yantra.org/?source=about_page "https://new.e-yantra.org/"), [Computer Science department TU Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/informatik?source=about_page "https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/informatik?source=about_page"), [CFILT IIT Bombay](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/?source=about_page "https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/"), [CDLI UCLA](https://cdli.ucla.edu/?source=about_page "https://cdli.ucla.edu/") and [UCLA NLP lab](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/?source=about_page "http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/"). My self-published poetry collection on Amazon Kindle - [*Gonzo Poet and through his lens*](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07M6CWQJJ?source=about_page "https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07M6CWQJJ") narrates my musings about self, society, love, family, religion, and nature in the process of self-discovery during that journey.

Returning back to India in 2019, I started consulting emerging start-ups in India, one of which [Goodhealthapp](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4?source=about_page "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodhealth-dde4"), a [YCombinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator") and [Elevation Capital](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/elevation-capital-6e8a?source=about_page "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/elevation-capital-6e8a") funded Startup later onboarded me as their Head of Engineering and Founding Team. That was the start of my entrepreneurial journey, where I built multiple products in insurance tech space with a very small team of only five developers. When Goodhealthapp wrapped up around Covid, I continued my journey in India's largest logistics unicorn [Delhivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhivery"), building their new [logistic SaaS platform](https://core-os-platform.readme.io/?source=about_page "https://core-os-platform.readme.io/") and solutions and launched Delhivery in Sri Lanka within a year . For me, that was the most challenging experience, which made me grew not just into Technology but also, into People, Processes and Product leadership.

I always, seek to challenge myself with new learning opportunities and focussed on building large scale software systems, which will stand the test of the time.

After launching Delhivery in Sri Lanka, I moved to [Amazon India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)") to start my next sprint as a part of Distribution Center Technology team in Amazon. I worked in Amazon Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), contributing to the core technology that powers Amazon's global fulfillment network. During my time there, I focused on optimizing inventory management, process automation, and scaling warehouse operations for efficiency.

Following this, I transitioned to [Amazon Ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Ads?source=about_page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Ads"), where I worked on building scalable solutions for advertisers, leveraging data and AI to optimize ad campaigns and drive customer engagement. This role allowed me to deep-dive into large-scale data systems, advanced analytics, and AI-driven personalization for digital advertising.

In September 2024, I took on a new challenge by joining [Turl Street Group (TSG)](https://www.turlstreet.com/?source=about_page "https://www.turlstreet.com/") as Chief Technology Officer (CTO). At TSG, I am leading the technology strategy, driving innovation, and scaling solutions that empower the company's vision to transform the way governance and civic platforms operate globally. This marks an exciting chapter as I continue to explore impactful technology-driven solutions in diverse domains.

I mostly spend time playing with stray dogs, caring about stray animals, reading non-fictional technical books ranging from Economics to even, Business and then, end up writing or debating on politics and public policies. I really enjoy writing, also as a published poet and as a blogger too. Read my poem here on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.in/Gonzo-Poet-through-his-lens-ebook/dp/B07M6CWQJJ?source=about_page "https://www.amazon.in/Gonzo-Poet-through-his-lens-ebook/dp/B07M6CWQJJ") and read my blogs here at this [blog](https://blog.jaykmr.com/?source=about_page "https://blog.jaykmr.com/") hosted on medium.

Ending on one of my mantras,

*Software Engineering is a disciplined art and so, let's create some large-scale masterpieces!*
